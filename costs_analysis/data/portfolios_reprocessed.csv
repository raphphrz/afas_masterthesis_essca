- Fund/Strategy name is the Merrill Lynch Strategic Portfolio Advisor® Service as the program described. No specific fund name is given.  
- Management fees: The highest applicable management fee for a $500,000 investment with a 50/50 equity/fixed income allocation is calculated from the maximum fee schedule:  
  - Equity portion (50% of $500,000 = $250,000) max fee = 1.50% annually  
  - Fixed income portion (50% of $500,000 = $250,000) max fee = 0.70% annually  
  - Weighted average fee = (0.5 * 1.50%) + (0.5 * 0.70%) = 0.75% + 0.35% = 1.10%  
- Transaction fees: The document states that transaction charges such as commissions, markups, markdowns, dealer spreads, and other charges are not included in the SPA fee and are charged separately, but no explicit numeric % is provided.  
- AUM: Not explicitly disclosed in the document.  
- Turnover rate: No explicit portfolio turnover rate mentioned.  
- Tax efficiency: Based on the standardized rule:  
  1) Tax-loss harvesting: Present via Direct Indexing Strategy discussion (yes) = 2 points  
  2) Tax-optimized asset location: Not explicitly stated = 0 points  
  3) Use of ETFs or index funds: ETFs mentioned as replacement securities in Direct Indexing Strategy (yes) = 2 points  
  4) Turnover rate < 50%: Turnover rate not stated, so cannot confirm = 0 points  
  5) Client-specific tax optimization: Not explicitly stated = 0 points  
  Total = 4 points. However, the document also discusses that Direct Indexing Strategies may trade more frequently, implying turnover may be higher, so no points for turnover. Tax-loss harvesting and use of ETFs are explicitly mentioned.  
  Therefore, tax efficiency score = 4.

Only (3) is explicit, so 2 points. No explicit mention of tax-loss harvesting, asset location, or client-specific tax optimization. Turnover rate unknown, so no points. Tax efficiency score is therefore 2 points for ETFs/index funds plus 4 points assumed for turnover <50% (cannot confirm, so not counted). Conservative estimate is 2 points.

- Fund/strategy names explicitly stated as ""Schwab Intelligent Portfolios®"" and ""Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium®.""
- Management fees: SIP Program has no direct advisory fee but clients pay ETF operating expense ratios; Schwab estimates a nominal 0.30% annual fee offset by affiliate compensation. SIP Premium ongoing advisory fee is $90 per quarter flat fee regardless of assets, which for a $500,000 investment equals 0.072% annually (90*4=360 / 500,000 = 0.072%). The Legacy Program fee is 0.28%, but the lower of the flat fee or legacy fee applies; thus, the highest applicable fee for $500,000 is 0.072% (flat fee). This numeric value is provided as 0.072 (7.2 basis points).
- Transaction/trading fees: Clients do not pay brokerage commissions in the Programs to Schwab; explicitly stated as zero.
- AUM not disclosed in the document.
- Portfolio turnover rate not explicitly mentioned.
- Tax efficiency score calculated based on explicit features:
  (1) tax-loss harvesting (yes, described in detail),
  (2) tax-optimized asset location (SII Algorithm considers tax status but not client-specific tax circumstances, so partial credit; however, client-specific tax optimization is not explicitly stated),
  (3) use of ETFs or index funds (yes, portfolios composed of ETFs),
  (4) turnover rate < 50% (turnover rate not stated, so cannot confirm),
  (5) client-specific tax optimization (not explicitly stated).
  Therefore, features (1), (3), and partial (2) apply. Since client-specific tax optimization is not explicit, it is excluded. Tax-loss harvesting and use of ETFs give 4 points, tax-optimized asset location is mentioned but not client-specific, so 2 points. Turnover rate unknown, so no points. Total 6 points. However, the text states the SII Algorithm considers tax status but not individual tax circumstances, so tax-optimized asset location is partial but not full client-specific tax optimization. To be conservative, assign 8 points (tax-loss harvesting, tax-optimized asset location, use of ETFs, turnover rate assumed <50% not stated but rebalancing is daily but no turnover rate given, so exclude turnover rate). The document does not explicitly state turnover rate, so exclude that feature. Client-specific tax optimization is not explicitly stated. So 3 features x 2 points = 6. But since turnover rate is not stated, exclude. So final tax efficiency score is 6.
- Document date explicitly stated as March 28, 2025.

Correction on tax efficiency score: The instructions say only count features explicitly mentioned. Tax-optimized asset location is mentioned as the SII Algorithm considers tax status of accounts but not individual tax circumstances or client-specific tax optimization. So (2) is partially present but not client-specific tax optimization (5). Turnover rate is not stated. So only (1) tax-loss harvesting and (3) use of ETFs are clearly present. So 2 features x 2 points = 4. Therefore, tax efficiency score is 4.

  (4) Turnover rate < 50%: Turnover rate not stated, so cannot confirm (0 points)  
  (5) Client-specific tax optimization: Not mentioned (0 points)  
  Additionally, the document mentions quarterly rebalancing for Automated Bonds and Equities (passive), and opportunistic rebalancing for equities, which suggests moderate turnover but no explicit rate. Tax-loss harvesting or client-specific tax optimization is not stated.  
  Therefore, only 2 points for use of ETFs/index funds.  
  However, the document also describes the use of tax logic in Smart Treasury for after-tax yield optimization, which is a form of tax-optimized asset location or client-specific tax optimization. This is described in detail under Smart Treasury section. This can be counted as client-specific tax optimization (2 points).  
  Also, the Automated Bonds and Equities are passively managed and rebalanced quarterly, which likely implies turnover < 50%, but since turnover rate is not explicitly stated, no points assigned.  
  Tax-loss harvesting is not mentioned.  
  Total points = 2 (ETFs) + 2 (client-specific tax optimization via Smart Treasury) = 4 points.  
  The document also states that the equity strategies are actively managed, but no mention of tax-loss harvesting.  
  Given the above, the tax efficiency score is 4 out of 10.

- Fund/strategy name is ""Model Portfolios"" as explicitly referenced multiple times as the managed investment strategy for participants.  
- Management fee stated as ""typically 0.12% annually"" for Participants in Item 5 ""Advisory Services Fees.""  
- No explicit transaction or trading fees stated in numeric % terms; only underlying fund fees and 12b-1 fees are mentioned but not quantified as transaction fees.  
- Assets Under Management (AUM) explicitly stated as $5,428,607,645 as of December 31, 2024 in Item 4 ""Assets Under Management.""  
- No explicit portfolio turnover rate mentioned in the document.  
- Tax efficiency score calculated based on explicit features:  
  (1) Tax-loss harvesting: not mentioned (0 points)  
  (2) Tax-optimized asset location: not mentioned (0 points)  
  (3) Use of ETFs or index funds: Model Portfolios currently include only passively-managed Investment Options (index funds) (2 points)  
  (4) Turnover rate < 50%: turnover rate not stated, but strategy is buy and hold with quarterly rebalancing and no short-term trading, implying low turnover; since not explicitly stated, this feature is not counted. (0 points)  
  (5) Client-specific tax optimization: not mentioned (0 points)  
  However, since turnover rate is not explicitly stated, cannot award points for that. The document states use of passive funds (2 points) and buy and hold strategy (implying low turnover but not explicit). Tax-loss harvesting and client-specific tax optimization are not mentioned.  
  Therefore, only 2 points for use of index funds.  
  But the instructions say ""only if explicitly mentioned."" The document states ""Model Portfolios currently include only passively-managed Investment Options,"" which is explicit.  
  No mention of tax-loss harvesting, tax-optimized asset location, or client-specific tax optimization.  
  Turnover rate is not explicitly stated, so no points.  
  So total 2 points.  
  However, the instructions say 2 points each for presence of each feature, capped at 10. So Tax Efficiency = 2.  
- Document date is ""Version Date: March 31, 2025"" from the header.  

Correction on Tax Efficiency: The instructions say ""Tax efficiency score is computed based on the presence of up to five features: (1) tax-loss harvesting, (2) tax-optimized asset location, (3) use of ETFs or index funds, (4) turnover rate < 50%, (5) client-specific tax optimization; 2 points each, capped at 10.""  
Only (3) is explicitly mentioned. (4) turnover rate is not explicitly stated. So only 2 points.  

Final: Tax Efficiency = 2
